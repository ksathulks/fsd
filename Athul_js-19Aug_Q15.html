		<p><b>JavaScript</b> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. <b>JavaScript</b> has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
            Alongside HTML and CSS, <b>JavaScript</b> is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[9] <b>JavaScript</b> enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[10] and major web browsers have a dedicated <b>JavaScript</b> engine to execute it.
            As a multi-paradigm language, <b>JavaScript</b> supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in which it is embedded to provide these features.
            Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, <b>JavaScript</b> engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make <b>JavaScript</b> available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.
            The terms Vanilla <b>JavaScript</b> and Vanilla JS refer to <b>JavaScript</b> not extended by any frameworks or additional libraries. Scripts written in Vanilla JS are plain <b>JavaScript</b> code.[11][12]
            Although there are similarities between <b>JavaScript</b> and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design. <b>JavaScript</b> was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.[13] The JSON serialization format, used to store data structures in files or transmit them across networks, is based on <b>JavaScript</b>.[14] </p>
